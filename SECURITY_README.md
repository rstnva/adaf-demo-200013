## 🔐 Security Configuration & Compliance Guide

**Environment:** Production  
**Security Level:** Hardened  
**Compliance:** SOC2, ISO27001 Ready  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  

---

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### **Container Security**
- ✅ **Non-root users** in all containers (node:node, postgres:postgres, redis:redis, nginx:nginx)
- ✅ **Read-only filesystems** with specific tmpfs mounts for necessary write operations
- ✅ **Dropped capabilities** (ALL) with minimal required capabilities added back
- ✅ **No new privileges** flag preventing privilege escalation
- ✅ **Resource limits** (memory, file descriptors, processes)
- ✅ **Security contexts** with seccomp and AppArmor profiles

### **Network Security**
- ✅ **TLS 1.2+ enforcement** with modern cipher suites
- ✅ **HSTS headers** with 1-year max-age and subdomain inclusion
- ✅ **Content Security Policy** (CSP) preventing XSS attacks
- ✅ **Rate limiting** (10 req/s general, 5 req/s API, 1 req/s auth)
- ✅ **IP whitelisting** for admin routes and metrics endpoints
- ✅ **NGINX security headers** (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

### **Data Protection**
- ✅ **Docker Secrets** for all sensitive data (passwords, keys, certificates)
- ✅ **Encrypted backups** with WAL-G and S3 server-side encryption
- ✅ **Database encryption** at rest and in transit
- ✅ **Secret rotation** capabilities with automated quarterly rotation
- ✅ **Minimum privilege** access patterns

### **Infrastructure Hardening**
- ✅ **High Availability** PostgreSQL with streaming replication
- ✅ **Redis persistence** with AOF and RDB backups
- ✅ **Blue-Green deployment** with automated rollback on failure
- ✅ **Health checks** at multiple layers (app, DB, Redis, NGINX)
- ✅ **Monitoring & alerting** with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger

## 🔑 Secrets Management

### **Created Secrets:**
```
postgres_password              - PostgreSQL main user password
postgres_replication_password  - PostgreSQL replication user password
app_secret_key                - Application encryption key (64 chars)
jwt_secret                    - JWT token signing secret (64 chars)
aws_access_key                - S3/WAL-G backup access key
aws_secret_key                - S3/WAL-G backup secret key
grafana_password              - Grafana admin password
redis_password                - Redis authentication password
```

### **Secret Rotation Schedule:**
- **Quarterly (90 days):** Application secrets, database passwords
- **Annually (365 days):** AWS credentials, SSL certificates
- **On-demand:** Emergency rotation for compromised secrets

### **Rotation Commands:**
```bash
# Automated quarterly rotation
./scripts/rotate-secrets.sh

# Manual emergency rotation
./scripts/setup-secrets.sh --emergency-rotate

# Verify secret integrity
docker secret ls | grep adaf
```

## 🚀 Deployment Security

### **Blue-Green Deployment Process:**
1. **Build verification** - Security scan, dependency check
2. **Canary deployment** - 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
3. **Health gates** - Automatic rollback on failure
4. **Security validation** - Runtime security checks

### **Pre-deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Security scan passed (no critical/high vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited
- [ ] Secrets rotation completed if due
- [ ] Backup verification completed
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards functional
- [ ] Runbook updated with any changes

### **Post-deployment Verification:**
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Error rates < 1%
- [ ] Response times p95 < 450ms
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration valid
- [ ] Rate limiting functional

---

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### **Key Security Metrics:**
- Failed authentication attempts per hour
- Rate limiting activation count
- SSL/TLS handshake failures
- Unusual traffic patterns
- File system changes (read-only violations)
- Container escape attempts

### **Security Alerts:**
```yaml
# High Priority (P0)
- Multiple failed auth attempts (>10/min)
- Container privilege escalation attempts
- SSL certificate expiration (<30 days)
- Unusual admin endpoint access

# Medium Priority (P1) 
- High rate limiting activation
- Suspicious user agents
- Unusual geographic access patterns
- File integrity check failures
```

### **Security Dashboards:**
- **Grafana Security Panel:** http://localhost:3001/d/security
- **WAF Logs:** NGINX access logs with security events
- **Container Security:** Runtime security monitoring

---

## 🔍 Compliance & Auditing

### **Audit Log Locations:**
```
Application Logs:    /app/logs/access.log (JSON format)
Database Logs:       PostgreSQL query logs with user tracking
NGINX Logs:          Access/error logs with security events
Container Logs:      Docker logs with security context
Backup Logs:         WAL-G backup and restore operations
```

### **Audit Trail Retention:**
- **Application logs:** 90 days local, 1 year archived
- **Security logs:** 1 year local, 7 years archived
- **Access logs:** 180 days with user correlation
- **Backup logs:** 2 years for compliance

### **Compliance Controls:**
- **Access Control:** Role-based with minimal privileges
- **Data Encryption:** AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit
- **Backup Security:** Encrypted, tested, geographically distributed
- **Change Management:** Version controlled, audited deployments
- **Incident Response:** Automated detection, documented procedures
